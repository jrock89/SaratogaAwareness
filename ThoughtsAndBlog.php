							<!-- <p>Even as we develop in the womb, our incredible body is establishing systems for survival.  When we enter the world, we are tested for our survival reflexes:  the Moro Reflex, or the spreading of the arms and then pulling in of the arms, usually followed by a cry in response to the   sudden lack of support or feeling of falling; the Startle Response, or pulling in of  the arms, in response to a loud noise; the instinct to grasp for a finger, root for a breast, and suck.  These reflexes, all rapid, unlearned, involuntary responses, each have an evolutionary function in our survival, whether it be in protecting ourselves, defending ourselves, or nourishing ourselves.  Our nervous system supplies the basis for this.</p> -->

							<!-- <p>The Feldenkrais Method® is a deliberate conversation with an individual’s nervous system about its body’s functioning and efficiency in action.  The language of this conversation is movement.</p> -->

							<h1><a href="#" style="color: #2F2E2F;">Why was the Feldenkrais Method created?</a></h1><img class="img-responsive imgMove" src="images/feld1.jpg"><br>
							<!-- <p>The Feldenkrais Method was developed by Moshe Feldenkrais, D.Sc.  of Israel in the 1940's and introduced to the United States in the early 1970's.  Dr. Feldenkrais was a distinguished scientist, physicist, engineer, and Judo instructor driven by a personal crippling injury to become concentrated on the exploration of the relationships between movement, thinking, feeling, learning and healing.</p> -->

							<!-- <p>Many of my peers in the Feldenkrais Method® prefer to, and excel at, working with certain populations.  There are practitioners who work specifically with Professional Dancers, Professional Musicians, or Professional Athletes.  While others specialize in working with children with neurological difficulties, the elderly, or pregnant women.</p> -->

							<!-- <p>The Feldenkrais Method is differentiated it into two complementary formats: Awareness Through Movement (ATM) and Functional Integration (FI).  The Awareness Through Movement format consists of structured movement lessons in which students are verbally guided through the exploration of their personal body relationships in a specific pattern of movement action (for example: crawling or turning over).</p> -->
