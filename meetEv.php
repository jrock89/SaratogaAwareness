								<div class="ev_about">
									Evan VanDyk, A.A.S, LMT, is a guild-certified Feldenkrais Practitioner and Awareness Through Movement Teacher. She studied the Feldenkrais Method in a 4-year Practitioner Training Program with David Zemach-Bersin at the Feldenkrais Institute of NY in Manhattan from 2011-2015.<br>
									<br>
									After graduating Massage school at Morrisville State College in 2010, she found her place among her peers at Bodywork Professionals, Licensed Massage Therapists in Latham and Saratoga Springs NY.<br>
									<br>
									As she progressed through her Feldenkrais training, the theory behind The Method began to become valid in every aspect of her life and work. Every thought and action was now somehow interconnected.. The same. Or to be more specific, more apparently the same. Her outlook changed, her curiosity grew. Her satisfaction with 'reality', and amazement at what was possible, were totally uprooted. Everything in her life became more interesting. At Bodywork Professionals, Evan became the General Manager and Managing LMT, 2nd in command behind the owner Nick D. Pavoldi. She works in the office 5 days/week and loves sharing her skills and building real human connections. In her work, she uses the principles of the Feldenkrais Method as well as her training in Massage Therapy to see her clients as whole beings, with incredible potential to improve and become more comfortable in their miraculous Body.<br>
									<br>
									At Bodywork Professionals Evan offers Feldenkrais Functional Integration sessions as well as all traditional massage sessions including Deep Tissue, Swedish, and Prenatal Massage. Her clients come back as they are empowered to become interested in their body and their health and Evan provides a space where they may explore this and learn to do what they want.<br>
									<br>
									Because as Moshe Feldenkrais, D.Sc., founder of the Feldenkrais Method, said: "If you know what you're doing, you can do what you want."<br>
									<br>
									In her down time, Evan enjoys being active and artistic and is always eager to learn new things.<br>
									<br>
									Join Evan for a 1hr. Sunday Awareness Through Movement class at RAW Fitness in Saratoga Springs<br>
									<br>
									Or book a one-on-one Functional Integration session at Bodywork Professionals' Saratoga Springs or Latham locations.<br>
									<br>
									Hope to see you soon ;)
